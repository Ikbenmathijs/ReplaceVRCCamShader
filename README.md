# ReplaceVRCCamShader
Very simple VRC shader that replaces the texture in the VRChat camera!

Put the shader on a sphere and make it cover the whole world, then drag the (render)texture you want to have in the VRChat camera in the material, and then pull out the in-game VRChat camera to see it working!
